1. All classes immutable

2. If class has an inner collection:
   a. Always use a Builder inner class.   Optionally write "of" methods for
      reasonable defaults that use the Builder.
   b. Write withXXX methods that create new objects and add the item to the list

      public Parent withChild(Child child) {
        return new Builder()
          .withAttribute(attribute)  // copy non-collection attributes to the new object
          .withChildren(children())  // adds existing children to the new object
          .withChild(child)          // adds new child
          .build();
      }

3. If class does not have inner collections, then
   a. If class has 3 or less attributes, use static builder methods named "of"
   b. If class has more then 3 attributes, use a Builder class.  Optionally
      write "of" methods for reasonable defaults that use the Builder
