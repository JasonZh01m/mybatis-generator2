Default Workflow:

  1. Introspect (map config objects to introspected objects)
  2. Filter tables and columns per configuration (filter introspected objects)
  3. Map introspection artifacts to generation artifacts (map introspected objects to generator objects)
  4. Generate code from generation artifacts (map generator objects to DOM objects)
  5. Render code (map DOM objects to Java/XML code)
